# Generate-new-sequence-of-text-using-RNN.

Build different language models using (LSTM, GRU, and LSTM &GRU) neural network that can predict the probability of the next word in the sequence, based on the words already observed in the sequence. And use the learned language models to generate new text with similar statisticalproperties as the source text.
